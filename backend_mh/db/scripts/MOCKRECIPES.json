Transfer to a baking tray lined with greaseproof paper, layering them up between sheets of paper until all of the fish is coated.",
      "Cook right away or freeze in the tray – once frozen, you can pop them into a tub or sandwich bags for easier storage.",
      "To cook, place however many jumbo fish fingers you need on a roasting tray and cook in a preheated oven at 200°C/400°F/gas 6 for 15 minutes from fresh, or 20 minutes from frozen, or until golden and cooked through."
